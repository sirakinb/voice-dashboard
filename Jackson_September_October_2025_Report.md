Voice AI Performance Case Study 

Jackson Rental Homes 

Overview 

An AI voice agent for Jackson Rental Homes answered and triaged 2,485 inbound calls over a 40-day period, capturing after-hours leasing opportunities worth hundreds of thousands in potential annual revenue—while delivering faster, more consistent information to prospective tenants 24/7. 

Performance Summary 

**Calls handled:** 2,485 (Aug 30 – Oct 8, 2025, \~5.7 weeks) 

**After-hours share:** 24.5% (608 calls captured after-hours) 

**Qualified after-hours leads:** \~84 per week (480 leasing intent calls after-hours) **Revenue potential:** $312K–$936K/year (at 5–15% lead → lease conversion) 

Problem 

**High inbound call volume with repetitive questions** — Over 2,400 calls in just 40 days, with 78% asking about property availability 

**Nearly one-quarter of calls arrived after business hours** — 608 calls (24.5%) occurred outside traditional business hours, creating missed opportunities and slower response times 

**Team capacity constraints** — Staff spent significant time answering the same basic questions about availability, pet policies, and application processes instead of focusing on showings, applications, and move-ins  
**Inconsistent information delivery** — Variable responses depending on staff availability and knowledge led to potential confusion for prospective tenants 

Solution 

**Deployed an AI voice agent** to answer calls 24/7, route inquiries, and collect contact details for follow-up 

**Automated answers for top intents:** property availability, pet policies, application status, showing requests, and Section 8/voucher inquiries 

**Ensured consistent information delivery** and lead capture during nights and weekends, with all call logs and transcripts synced to the team for next-day action 

**Provided immediate responses** to prospective tenants, reducing wait times from hours/days to seconds 

Results 

What Callers Asked 

**Property Availability:** 78.3% (1,945 calls) 

**Pet Policy Questions:** 3.3% (81 calls) 

**Application Status:** 2.6% (64 calls) 

**Showing/Tour Requests:** 1.8% (45 calls) 

**Section 8/Voucher Inquiries:** 0.4% (10 calls) 

**Other inquiries:** 13.3% (333 calls) 

24/7 Coverage Unlocked 

**After-hours calls:** 24.5% of all volume (608 calls)  
**Qualified after-hours leasing leads:** \~84 per week (480 calls with leasing intent) 

**Weekend capture:** 225 calls on Saturdays and Sundays that would have otherwise gone to voicemail 

**Peak after-hours value:** Every qualified lead represents a potential lease worth $1,200+ in annual management revenue 

Revenue Impact (Modeled) 

**Assumptions:** 

\- Average rent \= $1,028.02/month (based on portfolio) 

\- Management fee \= 10% 

\- Lease term \= 12 months 

\- **→ $1,233.62 net per signed lease per year** 

**Using qualified after-hours leads only (84 per week):** 

| Conversion Rate  | Leases/Week  | Leases/Year  | Revenue/Year |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 5%  | \+4.2  | \+218  | ≈ $268,929/year |
| 10%  | \+8.4  | \+437  | ≈ $539,091/year |
| 15%  | \+12.6  | \+655  | ≈ $808,021/year |

Extended Model 

**If we model uplift on ALL qualified leads (not just after-hours):** 

With 1,945 Property Availability calls \+ 45 Showing Requests \+ 64 Application Status \= **2,054 qualified leasing calls** over 40 days 

**\= \~359 qualified leads per week** 

Even at a conservative 5% conversion: 

\- **18 leases per week**  
\- **936 leases per year** 

\- **\>$1.15 million/year in management revenue** 

At 10% conversion: 

\- **36 leases per week** 

\- **\>$2.3 million/year in management revenue** 

Key Recommendations 

Immediate Actions 

**Review "Other" category calls** — 185 calls (7.4%) fell into this bucket. Analyzing these transcripts can reveal opportunities to refine AI responses or add new intent categories. 

**Follow up on Showing Requests** — 45 calls specifically asked to tour properties. These are hot leads that should be prioritized for immediate contact. 

**Optimize weekend follow-up** — Weekends show lower volume (15-22 calls/day) but still capture 225 calls total. Establish a Monday morning protocol to follow up on weekend inquiries when leads are still warm. 

Strategic Opportunities 

**Leverage after-hours leads** — With 84 qualified leads per week coming outside business hours, establish a next-day follow-up protocol to capitalize on these opportunities. 

**Pet-friendly marketing** — 81 calls about pet policies (3.3%) suggests this is a key tenant concern. Highlight pet-friendly properties in marketing materials. 

**Sunday activation** — Sundays generate strong call volume (71.7 calls/day average). Consider adding limited Sunday availability for hot leads who called over the weekend. 

Performance Tracking 

**Set monthly benchmarks** — Track conversion rates from AI-captured leads to signed leases to refine revenue models. 

**Monitor category trends** — Watch for shifts in inquiry types (e.g., increased application status calls may indicate strong funnel health).  
**Measure response time** — Track time-to-follow-up on after-hours leads to optimize conversion rates.
